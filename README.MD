# Learning JavaScript

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript practice files to introduce core concepts like arrays, conditionals, and loops.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

* **Arrays:** Contains exercises and examples related to working with arrays in JavaScript.
* **Conditionals:** Explores concepts like `if/else` statements and conditional logic.
* **Loops:** Covers different looping mechanisms (e.g., `for`, `while`) for repetitive tasks.

Each folder holds a single JavaScript file named `pr.js` (practice) that demonstrates the corresponding concepts.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repository to your local machine and run the JavaScript files within each folder to practice your understanding.
